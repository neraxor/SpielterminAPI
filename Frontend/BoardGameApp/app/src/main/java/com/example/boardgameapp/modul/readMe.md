At all classes are like C structs ;)
## User 

This class is designe for a continuous structure in interface communication. It contains all information they're\ 
important for a user./
The class contains two constructors:
- the standard constructor 
- and a constructor contains all information of a user

With using the setter methods you could easily manipulate the data 
and read data with the getters


Usage example:
```java

public void saveUser(User user){
            user.getName 
            user.getPasswort
            //and so on
        }

```
